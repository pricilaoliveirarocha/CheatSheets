# 📘 Cheatsheets

A collection of practical command-line references I use daily.  
This repository includes essential commands and workflows for:

- ⭐ **Linux** – navigation, file management, permissions, processes
- ⭐ **Git** – basic to advanced version control operations
- ⭐ **Windows** – CMD and PowerShell commands

Each section is organized into minimal, clean markdown files for quick lookup and learning.
